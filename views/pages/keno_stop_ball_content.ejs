<!-- GAME DESCRIPTION -->
<div class="game-info">
  <h2>Keno Stop Shot</h2>
  <p>
    Keno Stop Shot is another keno variant with an added twist. The player
    selects 1–10 numbers from a range of 1 to 40. The draw then begins,
    revealing numbers one by one. The draw continues until a “stop shot” appears
    — there are three of them in the pool. All numbers drawn before the stop
    shot count toward the player’s matches, and the payout is based on how many
    selected numbers were hit before the draw ends. The tension comes from not
    knowing how long the draw will last. RTP is 96.12%
