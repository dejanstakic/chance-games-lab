  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <p>
    81 Holds is a hold-and-spin style game played on a 9×9 grid divided into
    nine 3×3 sub-grids. At the start, only the first sub-grid is active and you
    have 3 respins.
  </p>
  <p>
    On each spin, all empty cells in the active grids spin independently. If a
    cell lands a winning value, that value is locked in place and the number of
    respins is reset to 3. New sub-grids unlock automatically when two-thirds of
    the active cells are filled.
  </p>
  <p>The game ends when no respins remain or all 81 cells are filled.</p>

  <p>Each spin costs 100 credits, and the game has an RTP of 96%.</p>
