  <h2>Keno 40</h2>
  <p>
    Keno is a quick, lottery-style numbers game. The player chooses a set of
    numbers from a fixed range, usually 1–80. After confirming the selection,
    the draw begins and a series of random numbers are revealed. Payouts follow
    the paytable, based on how many numbers the player selected and how many of
    them match the drawn numbers. The probability of winning depends on the size
    of the number range, how many numbers are drawn, and how many the player
    chooses. For example, in this version of the game, it’s possible to achieve
    an RTP of 104% if you choose the optimal number of selections. Other choices
    are typically around 97%, with an overall average RTP of about 97.6%. There
    are many Keno variations — some of them you can find here on this site.
